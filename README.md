## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

I learned how to group my html elements to reduce potential
css clutter. Initial I had each of my elements with individual margins to align the left hand side. I refactored to use a container that contains my margin for a more consistent look, with cleaner code. 

I also learned that margins can get very weird with sibling block style elements. My margins were overlaying, causing the spacing to be less than what I expected. I learned that margins on block elements get collapsed in certain cases. 

I also got to explore the box-shadow property to add the required detail to the card as per the challenge. 

Lastly, I got to explore using flex display in different orientations and using align-items and justify-content to centre the elements.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my code organizations, and try to have a more modular layout from the start. I feel like I spent a lot of time fussing with the layout to align the text when I could have just wraped my content and handled alignment in one place.
